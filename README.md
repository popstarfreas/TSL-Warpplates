# Warpplates
This is a TSL extension that adds warpplates. Warpplates are essentially areas that when a player stands in them, warp them to somewhere else. Right now this plugin supports only warping to another dimension.

## How to install
Via plugin manager
```
npm run pluginmanager install Warpplates popstarfreas/tsl-warpplates master
```
